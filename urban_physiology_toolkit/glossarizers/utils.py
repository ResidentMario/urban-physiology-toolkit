    """
    Times out a process. Taken from Stack Overflow: 2281850/timeout-function-if-it-takes-too-long-to-finish.

    Some notes:
    * Timing out a process, it turns out, is very hard. I wrote a timeout using multiprocessing.Queue from the
      standard library, wrapped in a package I named "limited-requests". It worked for simple files,
      but broke down on more complex ones, with the process simply hanging forever. I don't know why; I suspect
      that Queue implicity requires the operations that are placed in the queue not touch the filesystem,
      or somesuch. One day I would like to find out the answer why.

    * I don't claim to really understand this code. It uses UNIX signaling to get the OS to force the process to
      explode.

    * This means that even though it says it will throw a TimeoutError, in reality it seems to always throw a
      ChunkEncodedError instead (from requests). Or maybe it's that requests is intercepting the timeout and
      throwing its own error? Heavens knows.

    * It's UNIX-only.

    * It only allows timeouts in integers...amusingly.

    * It's very dangerous. XXX.

    * More details: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/22/how-not-to-set-a-timeout-on-a-computation-in-python

    * multiprocessing.Pool may provide a better interface. I do not know how to operate a multiprocessing.Pool
     though.
