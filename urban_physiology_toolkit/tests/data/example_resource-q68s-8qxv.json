File type is ESRI grid raster files at 300 m resolution, NAD83 New York Long Island State Plane FIPS, feet projection. Prediction surface generated from Land Use Regression modeling of December 2008- December 2015 (years 1-7) New York Community Air Survey monitoring data.As these are estimated annual average levels produced by a statistical model, they are not comparable to short term localized monitoring or monitoring done for regulatory purposes.
