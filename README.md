# urban-physiology-toolkit ![t](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-alpha-red.svg)

The Urban Physiology pilot project was a research project at NYU CUSP in 2017. The underlying goal of the project has been to develop an understanding of the challenges and opportunities in mixing urban datasets together. Is it possible to understand the patter of life in a city by examining the data that it publishes about itself?

Part of the challenge to addressing this question is in finding what it is, exactly, that we have to work with in the first place. Since municipalities and nations do not publish their data in any particular standard, this is not a trivial problem to solve: it requires writing a framework for handling all of the different kinds of data and different ways it can be published in, one that can conform all of that mess to a well-described, unified specification.

This repository (and its sisters) constitute that framework. It constitutes one conceptual half of the output of the pilot.

## Documentation
